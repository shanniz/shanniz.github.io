			<li> Step1: Land China (Kinda neccessary for the all the followings hahahaa) :) </li>
			<li> Buy a sim card at the airport (should cost around 150 RMB with 1GB Internet) </li>
			<li>About Transport:</li>
			<ul>
				<li> Get a transport card from a subway station. Charge it with 100-200 RMB or anything according to your use </li>
				<li> Each bus trip here in Beijing costs between 1-2 RMB, and subway trip costs between 4-5 RMB.</li>
				<li> Note: The transport card is different for different cities(As per my knowledge)</li>
			</ul>
			<li> About money</li>
			<ul>
				<li> The banks here use Unionpay system, but you can also use your VISA card(Don't know about other systems)</li>
				<li> Wechat pay and alipay payments systems are very popular and convenient here, but if you're new, carry cash along.</li>
